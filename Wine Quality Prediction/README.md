# Wine Quality Prediction
# Goal:
Some EDA and Machine Learning Classification Algorithm to predict the Quality of Wine
# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset

# Description:
This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).My task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

# What I have done:
->Importing the libraries

-> Loaded the dataset

->Preprocessing of the dataset:

-> Knowing some of the statistical measures information

-> Visualizing the data

-> Correlation

-> Splitting the dataset

-> Training the data

-> Models used: - Random forest classifier - SGD classifier - SVC

-> Evaluation of the model

-> Predicting the output of new data from the model having the high accuracy

# Model Used
-> Random Forest Classification

-> SVC

-> Decision Tree

-> KNN
